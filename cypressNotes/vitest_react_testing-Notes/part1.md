## Complete Notes: React Testing Library Tutorial (Vitest)

### I. Introduction and Core Concepts

Unit testing is an underrated skill often required for mid to senior-level React interviews. The goal of testing with React Testing Library (RTL) is to test React components **the way real users use them**.

RTL focuses on testing **what the user sees on the browser** (e.g., clicking buttons, navigating links, loading pages), instead of focusing on internal state or class names.

### II. The Tooling: Vitest vs. React Testing Library

The tutorial uses two main tools: Vitest and React Testing Library.

| Tool                      | Role                  | Functionality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vitest**                | **Test Runner**       | A modern, super fast replacement for Jest that fits well with the Vite ecosystem. It provides the tooling for writing tests, finds test files in the project, runs them, and offers features like `describe`, `it`, `expect`, mocking, and coverage. |
| **React Testing Library** | **Interaction Tools** | Provides the tools needed to interact with React components in the test environment. This includes finding elements, waiting, clicking, and typing in input boxes.                                                                                   |

#### How RTL Tests Code

RTL uses **JSDOM** (which must be installed as a package) to create a virtual browser environment and a **virtual DOM**. When a test runs via Vitest, the component renders in this virtual DOM. RTL then interacts with this virtual DOM using the `screen` API, allowing actions like clicking or typing text, and assertions can be put in place to verify behaviour.

### III. Setup and Configuration

1.  **Project Creation:** The project is created using Vite (e.g., `npm create vit @latest`).
2.  **Required Packages (Dev Dependencies):** The necessary packages are installed as development dependencies (`--save-dev` or `-D`):
    - `vitest` (the test runner).
    - `jsdom` (to create the virtual DOM).
    - `@testing-library/jestdom` (for DOM interactions).
    - `@testing-library/react` (the main RTL package).
    - `@testing-library/user-event` (for realistic user interactions).
3.  **Configuration:**

    - A test script is added to `package.json` (e.g., `"test": "vitest"`).
    - The `vite.config.js` file must be updated to configure the testing environment to use JSDOM (e.g., `environment: "jsdom"`).

    - Hereâ€™s a Vite config set up for Vitest with the JSDOM environment.

```js
// vite.config.js (JS)
// If using TypeScript, name it vite.config.ts and adjust types accordingly.
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: "jsdom", // Use JSDOM for DOM APIs in tests [web:79][web:74]
    setupFiles: ["./src/test/setupTests.ts"], // Optional: global test setup (e.g., jest-dom) [web:79]
    globals: true, // Optional: enable describe/it/expect as globals [web:79]
    css: true, // Optional: allow CSS imports in tests [web:79]
    coverage: {
      reporter: ["text", "html"], // Optional: coverage output formats [web:79]
    },
  },
});


// in ts format
// vite.config.ts (TS)
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',           // Required to simulate the browser DOM in Vitest [web:79][web:74]
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setupTests.ts'], // See setup file below [web:79]
  },
});

```

### IV. Writing Basic Tests

Test files must be named with the **`.test` suffix** (e.g., `app.test.tsx`) for Vitest to find them.

#### Test Structure Components

| Component        | Source                  | Usage                                                                                                    |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `describe`       | `vitest`                | Used to group test cases into a **test suit** (e.g., "App Component Test Suit").                         |
| `it`             | `vitest`                | Defines the actual test case. Test descriptions should be meaningful (e.g., "It should render...").      |
| `expect`         | `vitest`                | Used for assertions to verify that certain conditions are met.                                           |
| `render`         | `testing-library/react` | Used to **render the component** into the virtual DOM.                                                   |
| `screen`         | `testing-library/react` | The **page object** of the testing library, used to interact with the virtual DOM.                       |
| `screen.debug()` | `screen` API            | Prints the virtual DOM to the console, similar to a console log, used for verifying the rendered output. |

#### Test Control

- **`it.skip`**: Used to skip a specific test case.
- **`it.only`**: Used to run only a specific test case within a test suite.

### V. Picking Elements (Queries)

RTL offers three main ways (query types) to pick elements from the virtual DOM using the `screen` object. These queries are essential for interacting with or asserting the presence of elements.

| Query Type                             | Behavior                                                  | Use Case                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`get by`** (e.g., `get by text`)     | **Throws an error** if the element is not found.          | Use when an element is **mandatory** and must be present in the DOM. Failure indicates a bug.                                                            |
| **`query by`** (e.g., `query by text`) | **Returns `null`** if the element is not found.           | Use when an element is **optional** and its absence should not fail the test.                                                                            |
| **`find by`** (e.g., `find by role`)   | Handles **asynchronous operations**. Returns a `Promise`. | Use when picking elements that appear after an async event (like an API response or state update). Requires `await` and the test must be marked `async`. |

#### Query Variants

1.  For every method of picking an element (e.g., `by text`, `by role`, `by label text`), all three variants (`get by`, `query by`, `find by`) exist.
2.  **`get by role`** (and its variants) should be used most often because roles relate to accessibility and ensure testing mimics real user interaction.
3.  If multiple elements match a query (e.g., finding all elements with a specific text), use the "all" variants (e.g., `get all by`, `query all by`, `find all by`).

### VI. Testing Interactivity

Interactions like clicking and typing can be simulated using two methods:

1.  **`fire event`**: Handles interactions like a machine. When used for clicking, it does not require `await`.
2.  **`user event`**: Handles interactions just like a real user. This method is preferred and should be used most of the time. **Click operations using `user event` must be `await`ed**.

### VII. Testing API Calls (Mocking)

When building dynamic applications, testing server interaction is integral. However, **real APIs are never called in test environments**. The data must be mocked (faked).

1.  **Identify Target:** The `fetch` API call needs to be mocked so that the application runs the mocked function instead of the real fetch.
2.  **Mocking Fetch:** Use `v.spyOn` imported from Vitest, which is designed for mocking inbuilt functions.
3.  The mock must return a result value that simulates the nested promise structure of `fetch` (mocking the `fetch` result which returns the mocked `json` method, which in turn returns the desired user object).
4.  After clicking the fetch button, use a **`find by`** query (which is awaited) to assert that the asynchronously loaded data is present in the DOM.

### VIII. Advanced Concepts

#### A. Providers (Redux, Context, Router)

If a component being tested depends on values provided by a parent element (e.g., context values, Redux store data, or router history hooks), the component must be **wrapped in the appropriate provider** within the test environment.

- **Context/Redux:** The component must be wrapped inside the `Context Provider` or the Redux Provider (passing the required store) so that the component can access those values and the tests won't fail.
- **Router:** If the component uses hooks like `useNavigation` or `useHistory`, it must be wrapped in a `BrowserRouter` inside the test to access navigation data.

#### B. Asynchronous Utilities

- **`act`**: A utility from RTL used to ensure **all updates** applied to the DOM (including multiple state updates and side effects within a handler) are executed before any assumptions or assertions are made. It is useful for testing asynchronous updates and side effects.
- **`waitFor`**: Used to wait for a specific condition or assertion to become true.

#### C. Testing Custom Hooks

- **`renderHook`**: Imported from RTL, this utility is used to test **custom hooks in isolation**.
- Since hooks cannot be called outside a React component, `renderHook` wraps the hook inside a callback, allowing the tester to efficiently retrieve and test the hook's result.
